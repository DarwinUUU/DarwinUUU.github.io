<p>For this project I created a 3D desgin using the minecraft app. I used several of the blocks in the game to create an image of cultural significance. I settled in on creating a Poke ball because I felt that it was a easy layout and something that I was proud of creating. </p>

<p>The purpose of this project was to also give our image a cultural significance and why it matter to us. My reason for creating this is because I was always fascinated with Pokemon as a kid especially the pokeball. When I created this my hope was to show others that even today Pokemon still continues to be something that this young generation still values. </p>
