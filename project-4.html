<p>This is my 4th project for this class. In this project I made a 3D Design by using the 3D printer. I decided to seetle in on creating the Poke Ball that I created in the game of minecraft. I liked the idea of creating this project because I got to pick any design of my interest so I picked a Pokeball because his would best represent the my image. Creating something that I was influenced in my childhood years is what helped me further this idea. </p>

<p> I was happy with the overall outcome of how the print turned out. The design was pretty dull because it did not have a layout, however, the fun part was adding my own color and seeing the outcome. The purpose of cretaing this was to show people how much I loved Pokemon in my childhood years. I also wanted to relate to others because in this young generation, Pokemon still has a lot of significance. </p>
