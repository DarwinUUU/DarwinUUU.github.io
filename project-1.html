<p>For this project I created two glitch images using Text Edit and Audacity. The purpose of gitching was to give an image a aesthetic look. For my first image I chose Messi my favorite soccer player and one that is adored my many people across the world. The purpose of this image was to make him stand out as a great figure. I was pleased with the overall outcome of the glitch because that the image really makes him stand out as one of the greatest soccer players of all time. </p>

<p>For my second glitch image I created a glitch but this time I used Ronaldo. I chose this image because he is also one of the most adored soccer players around the world and is currently the face of Fifa. I thought that the overall glitch reallly represents him as a fearless player and one that has accomplished many trophies. The overall purpose of my glitch images was to show how we are enjoying the best moments of soccer because they are both unique players and we won't see similar talented players anytime soon. </p>
